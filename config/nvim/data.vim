" Non-fully compliant but okay TOML parser.
" This file uses the method operator (->) quite extensively:
" It just uses the expression before `->`
" as the first argument for the function after `->`.

" Parses a subset of TOML.
" `expr` has to be a list of strings,
" with each list entry being a line.
"
" Just throw `readfile` into it.
"
" The supported subset is:
"
" - Sections (of any depth)
" - Key-value pairs
" - Literal strings (i.e. no ", only ')
" - Comments
" - Empty lines
